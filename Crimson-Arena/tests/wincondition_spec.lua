    HOW A ROUND IS DECIDED, and there is more than one way.

    `Config.Match.winCondition` is one of the first settings in the file and
    it decides the shape of a whole match. Before this file, one of its two
    values was tested and the other was not: a mutation that inverted the
    comparison deciding whether `score_limit` is even consulted survived all
    fifty-two spec files.

      last_standing   the shipped default: the last side alive takes it.
      score_limit     first to `Config.Match.scoreLimit` kills.

    And two rules that are easy to get wrong and silent when you do:

      A TIE IS A DRAW, NOT A WIN.  A round that crowns the first of two level
                                   players pays a pot to somebody who did not
                                   earn it, and the server cannot honestly
                                   order two kills reported in the same tick.

      RUNNING OUT OF OPPONENTS     with one side left standing there is
      ENDS IT UNDER EVERY RULE     nothing left to decide it with, whatever
                                   the configured condition says.
